# pathfinder-app

a minimal web app that allows for quick searching and filtering of spells from the pen & paper RPG Pathfinder. The data comes from a collection of CSVs [1][] that I imported to a sqlite database to make more complex queries easier. The app itself is based off the excellent *react-quickstart*
