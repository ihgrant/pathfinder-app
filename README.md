# pathfinder-app

a minimal web app that allows for quick searching and filtering of spells from the pen & paper RPG Pathfinder. The data comes from a collection of [CSVs][] that I imported to a sqlite database to make more complex queries easier.

[CSVs]: http://www.pathfindercommunity.net/home/databases

## demo

http://pathfinder-app.herokuapp.com/#/

## installation

This project requires that you have [nodejs][] version 6 installed.

after you download the files or clone the repo, open Terminal, navigate to the base directory, and run `npm install`. when that's finished, enter `npm start` and navigate to the specified url in your browser of choice.

[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org

## to do

-	make it more mobile-friendly
-	support url queries corresponding to filter input
-	filter spells by magic school
