# pathfinder-app

a minimal web app that allows for quick searching and filtering of spells from the pen & paper RPG Pathfinder. The data comes from a collection of [CSVs][] that I imported to a sqlite database to make more complex queries easier. The app itself is based off the excellent [react-quickstart][].
